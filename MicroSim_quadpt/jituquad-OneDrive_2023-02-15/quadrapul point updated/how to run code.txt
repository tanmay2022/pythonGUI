First run the allan_chan_3D_quad point

It will generate updated matrix(mat2) with set_list_total.pkl and 
updated matrix(mat3) with j.pkl

Read these .pkl files in read mat2

This code will generate triple_data_timestamp.pkl files which cointans the 3d matrix for eac time stamp

Read the above generated triple_data_timestamp.pkl files in quad point. Here it generates teh triple point and these coordinates are stored in 
triple_point_coordinates_3D and triple_point_coordinates_3D.

Read triple_point_coordinates_3D and triple_point_coordinates_3D using read_triple and quad data.
Here you can generate graph to compare and print no of triple and quadrapul points at each time step.

To put the triple points and quadrapul points into a csv file use csv_test
